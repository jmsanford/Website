        This is going to be a react app. I throughly enjoyed learning the differences between routing this web app compared to YelpCamp. React is probably the future of web development because it makes reusing code so easy!

        I've been considering what to work on to put into my portfolio. There are tons of different fake project ideas out there. As I am still too new to find a true client, I decided to design/redesign the website for our favorite climbing gym. I believe they made theirs with Wix but I will start from scratch and see how far I get. Maybe they'll like my ideas.
